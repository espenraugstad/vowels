# Vowels

This collection includes a sample program written in multiple languages that counts the number of vowels in a sentence. The purpose of this collection is to demonstrate basic programming concepts in various programming languages.

The sentence used for testing is *The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog*, and the letter *y* is also counted as a vowel for this purpose. Both the sentence and the vowels are hardcoded to keep it easy.
